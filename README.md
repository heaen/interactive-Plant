# Interactive Plant

This is an experimental approach to strengthen awareness towards plants.
To have the maximum effect when touching the plant, use succulents.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to install arduino (or use the web editor).
I had two separated boards, therefore two seperated files.

touch.ino: plays sounds based on how you touch the plant.
distance.ino: plays sounds based on your distance to the plant.



## Usage

```
#include <CapacitiveSensor.h>
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
#include <DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h>
```
